This visualization utilizes a slope graph to explore how the undergraduate enrollments for each major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have fluctuated across the years. Each slope line represents the change in the number of students enrolled as that major from 2004 to 2018. The color of the slope line reflects this change with shades of green and red to represent increases and decreases respectively in the counts of students, and the luminance of the color decreasing as the change becomes less obvious.
